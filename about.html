	<p>I worked on <em>Wikidata Explorer</em> for the first two days of the jam before burning out and running out of time to do anything else due to Lifeâ„¢.</p>
	<p>My initial idea for this project can be summarized in a bulleted self-dialogue:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Hmm,
			<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page">Wikidata</a>
			has a lot of really neat info, but I find I don't browse it like I do Wikipedia...
			Is that because the UI doesn't encourage me to peruse it as much?
		</li>
		<li>Wikidata is basically a really really big graph, right?</li>
		<li>What if I could render that graph?</li>
		<li>I could then let the user click on nodes so that they can explore related topics and see how exactly they're connected to each other...</li>
		<li>If I execute this correctly, this could actually be a really productive exploration tool!</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		I still think that the potential for it to be that is still there, but in practice I wasn't able to easily do this. The main issue is Wikidata
		entries have a lot of edges (<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q17">Japan</a> has over three hundred), and making graphs where a small number of nodes
		have a large number of edges is really hard to manage; it's frustrating when your graph unknowingly explodes. I couldn't find or imagine a layout algorithm
		which would make this tool more human-friendly, so I just kinda set it aside. Graphs are not always the best UI tool, even if the underlying data is modeled 
		as such.

		<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#hytradboi:scattered-thoughts.net">#hytradboi</a> for being super chill and great people to talk to;
		can't wait to see everyone's awesome projects!
